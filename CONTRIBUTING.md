3. Write your code and tests
4. Ensure your code passes all tests and linting
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
- **Poetry** (for dependency management)
- **Git**

### Installation for Development

1. Clone your fork of the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ArchiPy.git
   cd ArchiPy
   ```

2. Set up the project environment:
   ```bash
   # Set up project pre-requisites (only needed once)
   make setup

   # Install development dependencies
   make install-dev
   ```

### Development Commands

ArchiPy provides a comprehensive Makefile to simplify development tasks. Here are the most common commands:

#### Environment Management
```bash
# Install core dependencies
make install

# Install development dependencies (including all extras)
make install-dev

# Update dependencies to their latest versions
make update
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code using black
make format

# Run all linters (ruff, mypy)
make lint

# Run pre-commit hooks on all files
make pre-commit

# Run all checks (linting and tests)
make check
```

#### Testing
```bash
# Run BDD tests with behave
make behave
```

#### Building and Versioning
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Build project distribution
make build

# Display current version
make version

# Bump patch version (for bug fixes)
make bump-patch

# Bump minor version (for new features)
make bump-minor

# Bump major version (for breaking changes)
make bump-major

# Custom version message
make bump-patch message="Your custom message"
```

#### Docker Operations
```bash
# Build Docker image
make docker-build

# Run Docker container
make docker-run
```

#### CI Pipeline
```bash
# Run the complete CI pipeline locally
make ci
```

For a complete list of available commands:
```bash
make help
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all tests, linting, and type checking (`make check`)
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Include tests for new features or bug fixes
4. The PR should work for Python 3.13 and above
5. All CI checks must pass before merging

Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. Maintainers may request changes or ask questions about your implementation.

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch version** (make bump-patch): Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Minor version** (make bump-minor): New features, non-breaking changes
- **Major version** (make bump-major): Breaking changes, significant refactoring

Version bumping is handled through the `scripts/bump_version.py` script and can be triggered with the appropriate make commands.
