## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern Python Stack**: Built with Python 3.13 and leveraging tools like `pydantic`, `fastapi`, `gRPC` and
  `sqlalchemy`.
- **Modular Design**: Optional dependencies for Redis, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, and more.
- **Type Safety**: Enforced by `mypy` and `pydantic` for robust code.
- **Testing**: Integrated with `pytest` and `behave` for comprehensive testing.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Uses `ruff` and `black` for clean and consistent code.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automates code quality checks before commits.
- **Dependency Management**: Managed by `poetry` for reproducible builds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
  `archipy` is compatible with Python 3.13 and above but does not support Python 4 or higher.
  To check your Python version, run:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  If your Python version is lower than 3.13, [download and install the latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Poetry** (for dependency management)
  Poetry is required to manage dependencies and install the project. If you don't have Poetry installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
