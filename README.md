## **Structured Python Development Made Simple**

ArchiPy is a Python framework designed to provide a standardized, scalable, and maintainable architecture for modern applications. Built with Python 3.13+, it offers a suite of tools, utilities, and best practices to streamline configuration management, testing, and development workflows while adhering to clean architecture principles.

## üéØ Goals

ArchiPy is built with the following objectives in mind:

1. **Configuration Management & Injection**
   Simplify and standardize configuration handling with tools like `base_config.py` and dependency injection, ensuring consistent and reusable setups across projects.

2. **Common Adapters & Mocks**
   Provide ready-to-use adapters (e.g., Redis, SQLAlchemy, email) with corresponding mocks for seamless delegation and testing without external dependencies.

3. **Standardized Entities & DTOs**
   Offer base entities, data transfer objects (DTOs), and type definitions to enforce consistency and reduce boilerplate in data modeling.

4. **Common Helpers for Everyday Tasks**
   Include a rich set of utilities, decorators (e.g., retry, singleton), and interceptors (e.g., FastAPI rate limiting, gRPC tracing) to simplify routine development work.

5. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Support**
   Integrate `behave` with pre-configured examples for synchronous and asynchronous scenario testing, enabling robust feature validation.

6. **Best Practices & Development Structure**
   Leverage `poetry`, `pre-commit`, `pyproject.toml`, and tools like `ruff` and `black` to enforce coding standards and provide an optimal Python development structure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Config Standardization**: Tools for managing and injecting configurations effortlessly (`base_config`, `config_template`).
- **Adapters & Mocks**: Pre-built adapters for Redis, SQLAlchemy, and email, with mocks like `redis_mocks` and `sqlalchemy_mocks` for testing.
- **Data Standardization**: Base entities (`base_entities.py`), DTOs (e.g., `pagination_dto`, `error_dto`), and type safety with `pydantic` and `mypy`.
- **Helper Utilities**: A collection of reusable tools including `datetime_utils`, `jwt_utils`, `password_utils`, and decorators like `sqlalchemy_atomic` and `timing_decorator`.
- **BDD Testing**: Fully integrated `behave` setup with feature files (e.g., `app_utils.feature`) and step definitions for sync/async testing.
- **Modern Tooling**: Dependency management with `poetry`, code quality with `ruff` and `black`, and pre-commit hooks for automated checks.
- **Modular Design**: Optional dependencies for Redis, FastAPI, gRPC, PostgreSQL, and more, installable via `archipy[feature]`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before using ArchiPy, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
  Check your version with:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  [Download Python 3.13+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.

- **Poetry**
  Install Poetry for dependency management: [Poetry Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## üöÄ Installation

### From PyPI

Install ArchiPy easily with `pip` or `poetry`:

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install archipy

# With optional dependencies (e.g., Redis and FastAPI)
pip install archipy[redis,fastapi]
```

Using Poetry:
```bash
poetry add archipy

# With optional dependencies
poetry add archipy[redis,fastapi]
```

### From Source

For development or cutting-edge features:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyntaxArc/ArchiPy.git
   cd ArchiPy
   ```
2. Set up the project:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
